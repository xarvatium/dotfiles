# DotFiles

If you've found this, this is where I store my dotfiles and other assets I use to make customization a lot easier, I don't own any of the images under the images directory (unless otherwise specified), and they fall under their respective license(s).

The directory layout is similar to a standard Linux layout, the home directory is $HOME, and anything in the root directory is specified (/etc for example). The .config directory is your standard one stored in $HOME, and .zshrc is stored in $HOME by default. I don't customize my Vim a lot so I don't have a .vimrc. The static directory is just general stuff like images, fonts, etc. for storage.
